    text: "I own a property management business and needed to find a new HVAC company to service my rentals. I had heard great things about Dependable Air and decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did! They are honest, reliable and have the best prices. Unlike other HVAC companies I've worked with they only repair what needs to be repaired and give upfront prices. Best of all I know I'm covered by their warranties and they respect my tenants.",
